The convention I would like to use is to create a new folder for each Visualizer 
and the appropriate classes necessary for that Visualizer will live inside the new folder.

So if we want a new Visualizer for strings create a StringObject folder
and put in the appropriate classes.  Yeah I know, why would we want one for strings? :-)
