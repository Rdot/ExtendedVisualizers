# ExtendedVisualizers

A project for Visual Studio 2010 Visualizers.  


## ExtendedDataSetVisualizer

Currently contains an Extended DataSet Visualizer for VS2010.   Yes, we have legacy code that uses DataSets :-).

The Visualizer lets you see all the rows in a DataSet whether they are Added, Deleted or Modified.  This can help when 
troubleshooting issues.

The Extended DataSet Visualizer is a port of what I did in 2006 for my team, except this is a Visualizer and not an add-in.

Here is an article I wrote - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16199/Extended-DataSet-Quick-Watch for the old Add In.

This Visualizer doesn't have row filtering.


## INSTALLATION

To Install the ExtendedVisualizers see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sb2yca43.aspx


Other Visualizers are welcome :-)
